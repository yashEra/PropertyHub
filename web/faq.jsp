                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Question 1<br>What is the difference between a real estate agent and a real estate broker?</dt>
                        <dd>Answer:- <br>A real estate agent is licensed to represent buyers and sellers in real estate transactions. They work under a licensed real estate broker. A broker, on the other hand, 
                            has completed additional education and licensing requirements and can work independently or manage a real estate brokerage.</dd>
                        <dt>Question 2<br>How do I find a reputable real estate agent?</dt>
                        <dd>Answer:-<br>You can find a reputable real estate agent by asking for referrals from friends, family, or colleagues who have had positive experiences with agents in the past.
                            You can also research agents online, read reviews, and interview multiple agents before making a decision.</dd>
                        <dt>Question 2<br>What is the process of buying a home?</dt>
                        <dd>Answer:- <br>The home-buying process typically involves the following steps:
                            a. Determine your budget and get pre-approved for a mortgage.
                            b. Engage a real estate agent to help you find suitable properties.
                            c. Visit and evaluate properties, making offers on the ones you like.
                            d. Negotiate the terms of the purchase, including price, contingencies, and closing dates.
                            e. Conduct inspections and appraisals to assess the property's condition and value.
                            f. Finalize the financing, secure homeowner's insurance, and complete any necessary paperwork.
                            g. Attend the closing, where you'll sign the final documents and transfer ownership.</dd>
                        <dt>Question 4<br>What is a down payment?</dt>.
                        <dd>Answer:-<br>A down payment is the initial upfront payment made by a buyer toward the purchase price of a property. It is typically a percentage of the total purchase price, often ranging from 3% to 20% or more. 
                            The larger the down payment, the lower the mortgage amount and potentially the interest rate.</dd>
                        <dt>Question 5<br>What are closing costs?</dt>
                        <dd>Answer:-<br>Closing costs are the fees and expenses associated with finalizing a real estate transaction. They typically include costs such as loan origination fees, appraisal fees, title insurance, attorney fees, recording fees, and prepaid property taxes and insurance.
                            Closing costs are typically paid by both the buyer and the seller and can range from 2% to 5% of the purchase price.</dd>
